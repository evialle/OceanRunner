h1. OceanRunner


h2. Introduction 

A problem, with JUnit is that you CAN'T use multiple interesting Runners for a Test: *OceanRunner* tries to solve that problem.
By offering an easy way to integrate _"RunnersLike"_ class, named _*OceanModule*_, you may conjugate many behaviors of unit testing strategy.

When you can use a single Runner for test, you may use many *OceanModules*.

h2. Built in OceanModules:

* *@CategoryOceanModule@*: include or exclude tests based not only on annotations
* *@ConcurrentOceanModule@*: run simultaneously different tests
* *@JUnit3AdapterOceanModule@*: run your JUnit3 tests
* *@StatisticsOceanModule@*: process statistics about last success/failure of your test _(not fully implemented)_ 

h2. Creating your own OceanModule

Simply extend your class by @it.freshminutes.oceanrunner.modules.engine.OceanModule@
And put at the top of your class to Test:

@RunWith(OceanRunner.class)
@OceanModulesToUse({_MyOwnOceanModule.class_, _MyOwnOceanModule2.class_, _MyOwnOceanModule3.class_})
public class Test {
	...
}
